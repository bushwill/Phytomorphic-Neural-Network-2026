// Step 0: Prepare Vlab-5.0 directory (only needs to be done if vlab-5.0 directory is not present): //

tar -xzf vlab-5.0-3609-ubuntu-20_04.tar.gz


// Step 1: To create container: //

./start.sh

-- OR --

docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d


// Step 2: To attach to container and start a bash shell: //

. ./connect.sh

-- OR --

docker exec -it instance1 bash


// Step 3: Once attached, run the following to install vlab and set up environment: //

. ./setup.sh (once the default config file is copied, press 'enter' key to finalize, this will take several minutes)

-- OR --

. ./vdsetup.sh (for virtual display, same process as . ./setup.sh but vlab wont start automatically)

// Step 4: Virtual Display Setup (only for vdsetup option): //

Connect to the virtual display by connecting to localhost:6080 in your web browser.
Start vLab by using the following command in the virtual display terminal:

. ./vlab_setup.sh

The browser app window should open after running this command, and vLab should be functional.
